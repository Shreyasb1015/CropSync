# CropSync

CropSync is a user-friendly website designed to assist farmers in selecting the right crops for their fields and providing essential information throughout the farming process. This project aims to simplify the decision-making process for farmers by offering valuable insights and data-driven recommendations.

## Features

CropSync offers the following features:

1. **Crop Selection**: Farmers can input their field parameters, such as location, soil type, climate, and available resources. CropSync utilizes this information to suggest suitable crops that are likely to thrive in the given conditions.

2. **Crop Information**: Detailed information about each recommended crop is provided, including growth requirements, planting techniques, optimal seasons, pest and disease management, and estimated yield potential. This empowers farmers with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions.

3. **Farming Calendar**: CropSync generates a personalized farming calendar based on the selected crops and local weather conditions. The calendar highlights important dates for activities like planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvest. It serves as a convenient reminder and helps farmers stay organized throughout the farming season.
